"""Shared fixtures for `gaia author <verb>` tests.

The :func:`gaia_package` fixture produces a minimal-but-valid Gaia
knowledge package on disk, matching v0.5 conventions:

* ``pyproject.toml`` with ``[project] name`` ending ``-gaia`` plus
  ``[tool.gaia].type = "knowledge-package"``.
* ``src/<import_name>/__init__.py`` importing the DSL surface and
  declaring at least one ``claim`` so the package is non-empty (some
  invariants only fire when there's something to collide with).
* ``__all__`` populated so post-write loading can read the exported
  symbols.

The fixture returns a small dataclass with the package root, source
``__init__.py`` path, and a couple of well-known seed labels — tests
use those labels directly when exercising reference resolution.
