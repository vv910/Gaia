# `gaia search`

Search retrieval providers for Gaia authoring.

```text
gaia search lkm knowledge <query>           Search LKM claim/question nodes
gaia search lkm reasoning <query>           Search LKM reasoning chains
gaia search lkm reasoning --claim-id <id>   Fetch reasoning chains for one claim
gaia search lkm nodes <ids...>              Fetch LKM graph nodes by id
gaia search lkm package [identifier]        Fetch one LKM paper package candidate
gaia search lkm auth ...                    Manage the LKM access key
```

The current implementation is an LKM provider adapter. Search-oriented LKM
verbs return Gaia-normalized JSON by default and write pretty JSON to stdout or
to `--out PATH`.

Use `--format raw-json` on `knowledge`, `reasoning`, or `package` to
inspect the upstream LKM JSON envelope directly.

Use `--index <id>` on LKM verbs to select a configured LKM index. This follows
the same split as `pip` / `uv`: the dependency or source ref stays stable,
while the index name resolves to the real URL and credential configuration.
This build ships `bohrium` as the default configured index; `--server` remains
a compatibility alias. Additional indexes can be added by setting
`GAIA_LKM_INDEX_<NAME>_URL`.

Hidden compatibility aliases remain available for older PR builds:
`claims` for `knowledge`, `reasoning-search` for query-mode `reasoning`,
`variables` for `nodes`, and `paper-graph` for `package`.

## Design Contract

The `search` group is provider-shaped by design:

- `lkm` searches a configured LKM graph index, defaulting to `bohrium`.
- Future `pkg` search should search installed Gaia Python packages.
- Future cross-provider search should wait until both providers share a stable
  Gaia-native result envelope.

Search commands should not mutate the current project. They may suggest
follow-up actions, but package materialization, installation, and dependency
changes belong to `gaia pkg add`. In normalized JSON, action `kind` + `ref` are the stable
machine-readable contract; `next_steps` is only a human/agent hint, matching
the broader Gaia CLI convention of printing "Next" guidance after scaffold or
registration workflows.

LKM refs include the LKM index id so multiple backends can coexist without id
collisions. Gaia emits canonical refs such as `lkm:bohrium:paper:<paper_id>`
and `lkm:bohrium:claim:<claim_id>`; short refs like `lkm:paper:<paper_id>` are
only compatibility aliases for the default index. Human-facing next steps
should prefer explicit flags, for example
`gaia pkg add --lkm-index bohrium --lkm-paper <paper_id>`.

LKM paper results are name-first and id-backed. Search results and action labels
should show the paper title when available (`source.paper_title`,
`actions[].label`), while `actions[].ref` and `source.paper_id` remain the
stable identity used by `gaia pkg add`, registry lookup, and local package
metadata.

`gaia pkg add --lkm-index <id> --lkm-paper <paper-id>` consumes the paper action
ref by fetching `/papers/graph`, generating a project-local Gaia package under
`.gaia/lkm_packages/`, compiling that package, and adding it as an editable
`uv` dependency. The generated package remains a standard Python Gaia package,
so downstream code imports it with normal Python imports. Generated LKM factors
use `depends_on(...)` by default: think of this as the scaffold form of
`derive(...)`, preserving the dependency relation without yet making it a
formal Gaia reasoning edge in IR/BP.

LKM retrieval scores are ranking signals only. They must not be copied into
Gaia priors, beliefs, or warrant strengths.

`reasoning` returns reasoning-chain search results. Normalized results expose
`source.factors` as a per-factor list of `{factor_id, premise_count}`. A factor
with premises and a conclusion is a candidate Gaia `derive(...)`. A factor with a
conclusion but no premises is not a reasoning failure and is not lowered to
`derive(..., given=[])`; in reasoning search it usually means the result is an
intermediate paper-chain node whose upstream premises are outside this slice.
Normalized `gaia-json` keeps the factor, adds a non-warning `comment` on that
`source.factors[]` entry, and includes an `inspect` action whose `next_steps`
runs `gaia search lkm package --index <index> --paper-id <paper>` so agents can
fetch the whole paper package and recover the prior reasoning-chain/conclusion
chain that the current conclusion depends on. A factor with premises but no
inline conclusion is an incomplete LKM payload, not a valid continuation and not
a candidate `derive(...)`; normalized `gaia-json` leaves `gaia.object_kind`
unset and annotates that `source.factors[]` entry with a `warning`.

The planned normalized result schema and the `search` / `pkg add` boundary are
tracked in the internal draft `docs/specs/2026-05-20-gaia-search-design.md`.
