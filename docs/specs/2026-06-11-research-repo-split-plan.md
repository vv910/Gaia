## Goal A: Repo Split and Gaia Connection

The current delivery goal is **Goal A**: split Gaia's research implementation
into an independent `gaia-research` repository and keep it connected to Gaia
through public core APIs, plugin entry points, contract CI, and a migrated
review-run workflow.

Goal A is not the same as delivering every future research capability. In
particular, large-scale graph sessions are now tracked as a follow-up capability
in [#767](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/767). Goal A should
not be considered incomplete merely because graph-session execution has not
been implemented. It should only avoid architectural choices that would make
that follow-up hard or impossible.

Goal A includes:

1. **Repository extraction**: `gaia-research` exists as its own git repository,
   with migrated code, tests, docs, package metadata, and skill assets.
2. **Gaia connection**: Gaia core exposes the public surfaces research needs,
   and `gaia research` delegates through a plugin when `gaia-research` is
   installed.
3. **Review-run parity**: the current package-native review-run workflow keeps
   working from the new repo, with SDK/CLI/skill smoke tests proving observable
   state, events, checkpoints, and report paths.
4. **Future graph compatibility**: `.gaia/research/**` ownership, SDK layering,
   and promotion discipline leave room for #767 without requiring a second
   canonical research protocol.

The future capability roadmap remains:

| Concern | Review run mode | Graph session mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main output | Evidence-backed Markdown report plus trace | Durable nodes, edges, focuses, obligations, and field map |
| Time shape | Bounded run, usually minutes | Long-lived session, many resumable steps |
| Default stop | Produce report or human-review checkpoint | Continue until frontier/budget/focus policy says stop |
| State updates | Run state, events, artifacts, report | Append-only graph/session log plus checkpoints |
| Gaia source writes | Explicit sync/promotion gates only | Explicit sync/promotion gates only |

PR #755 is the implementation body for the review-run path that Goal A migrates.
The closed PR #726 `gaia-research-loop` branch is **not** revived as a second
canonical workflow. Its task-envelope, candidate-validation, repair, and gate
lessons are now background for #767.

## 0. Current State and Feasibility

**Conclusion: extractable, and the boundary is unexpectedly clean.** Key facts:

- **Size**: 18 engine modules, 8,402 LOC + 5 CLI files, 4,954 LOC + 5,934 LOC of
  tests + the `gaia-research-loop` skill (~52 KB docs) + docs.
- **Reverse dependency (core → research) is a single line**:
  `app.add_typer(research_app, name="research")` in `gaia/cli/main.py`. A grep
  over the repo finds no other non-research code importing research code.
- **Forward dependencies (research → core) concentrate in five surfaces**
  (section 1).
- **Known coupling debt** (from the PR #755 review; must be fixed before the
  split):
  - `gaia/engine/research/sync.py:20-22` imports CLI-layer modules
    `gaia.cli.commands.author._authored` / `._common` / `._writer` (engine
    purity violation).
  - `research_providers.py` raises `typer.Exit` on an engine call path, and
    `ResearchOrchestratorError(exit_code=0)` doubles as a pause signal (review
    finding 14) — the port layer has no documented error contract.
  - The four high-severity review findings (stop-heuristic field mismatch,
    dropped `limitations`/`next_queries`, failures leaving `state.json` at
    `running`, chain-package dist-name collision) were addressed at head
    `44a3e4e2`; the remaining medium-severity follow-ups are tracked in
    [#761](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/761), and the
    research-sync relation validation holes in
    [#764](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/764). Both must be
    resolved or explicitly re-homed before the split; carrying known-broken
    contracts across two repos doubles the repair cost (section 7).

## 1. Dependency Boundary (five core surfaces research consumes)

| # | Core surface | Current location | API used by research | Problem |
|---|--------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| 1 | LKM search client | `gaia/cli/commands/search/lkm/_client.py`, `_shared.py`, `_indexes.py` | `LKMClient`, `run_request()`, `DEFAULT_LKM_INDEX_ID`, `normalize_lkm_index_id` | Buried under the CLI package with underscore-private names; `run_request` expresses errors as exit codes (4xx and network errors both map to exit 2 — review finding 11) |
| 2 | Authoring writes | `gaia/cli/commands/author/_authored.py`, `_writer.py`, `_common.py` | `ensure_authored_submodule()`, `append_statement()`, `split_csv_refs()` | Engine `sync.py` imports CLI modules directly |
| 3 | pkg add machinery | `gaia/cli/commands/add.py` + `gaia/cli/commands/pkg/lkm_materialize.py` (1,109 LOC) | `add_lkm_paper_dependency` / `add_lkm_claim_dependency` / `add_lkm_chain_dependency` / `add_local_package_dependency`; all of `lkm_materialize` | `lkm_materialize` is **shared code** (`gaia pkg add` uses it too) and cannot move with research |
| 4 | Inquiry state | `gaia/engine/inquiry/state.py` | `load_state()`, `save_state()`, `mint_qid()`, `SyntheticHypothesis`, `SyntheticObligation`, `append_tactic_event()` | Already engine-level, but never declared a public stable API |
| 5 | Credentials / misc | `gaia/cli/_credentials.py` (`read_lkm_key()`), `gaia.engine.packaging.GaiaPackagingError` | — | Credential reading also lives under the CLI |

Third-party dependencies: the engine side needs only pydantic (nearly a pure
library); the CLI side needs typer + litellm (lazily imported, `llm` extra) +
httpx (indirectly via the LKM client).

## 2. Target Architecture

**New repository `gaia-research`: one distribution, five layers** (not separate
distributions — the current size does not justify that):

```
gaia-research/
  src/gaia_research/
    engine/        # pure library: shared kernel, review-run orchestration,
                   # landscape, assessment, report, stop, sync; zero typer imports
    contracts/     # pydantic models for disk artifacts, events, graph records,
                   # task envelopes, provider I/O, and schema-versioned files
    sdk/           # public facade for downstream apps (new; section 4, S2)
    providers/     # litellm / command / checkpoint providers (litellm behind [llm] extra)
    skills/        # packaged Gaia/Codex skill assets and registration metadata
    cli/           # typer app; console script `gaia-research`
  pyproject.toml   # name=gaia-research, requires gaia-lang>=0.6,<0.8; extras: llm
```

- Dependency direction: `gaia-research → gaia-lang` (core), never the reverse.
- `gaia research ...` keeps working through a core CLI plugin mechanism (R2),
  alongside the standalone `gaia-research` entry point.
- Ownership of the on-disk contract `.gaia/research/**` (`state.json`,
  `events.ndjson`, manifest, trace, benchmark) transfers to the research repo
  and is explicitly versioned — downstream UIs depend only on that contract
  plus the SDK, never on internal modules.
- Review runs are the Goal A engine concept. The CLI and skill surfaces call
  the same SDK that product backends call; they are not separate
  implementations.
- Graph sessions are a reserved follow-up capability (#767). The repository
  layout should leave a natural place for them, but Goal A does not implement
  `.gaia/research/sessions/**`.

### 2.1 Shared Kernel

The shared kernel owns:

- provider-neutral search/query planning;
- landscape and field-map construction;
- focus, obligation, and evidence-reference normalization;
- append-only event and artifact writes;
- checkpoint creation, validation, and resume routing;
- stop/frontier policy;
- promotion/sync adapters into Gaia package and inquiry state.

Mode-specific orchestration is thin:

- Review run mode wires the kernel into the PR #755 sequence:
  `query_plan -> broad_search -> field_map -> focus -> selected_evidence ->
  assess -> stop -> report`.
- Graph-session mode is tracked in #767 and should later wire the kernel into
  an incremental loop:
  `frontier_batch -> search/materialize/analyze -> node_edge_delta ->
  field_map_delta -> focus_policy -> checkpoint/continue`.

### 2.2 Unified Disk Contract

All target state lives under `.gaia/research/**`; the split must not introduce a
new canonical `.gaia/research_loop/**` tree.

```
<pkg>/.gaia/research/
  manifest.json
  runs/<run-id>/
    state.json
    events.ndjson
    checkpoints/
    searches/
    analysis/
    trace/
    final_report.md
```

Every JSON/JSONL record carries `schema_version`. `events.ndjson` is the audit
spine. The compact `state.json` files are indexes and UI summaries; they must be
rebuildable from append-only records plus artifacts.

The `.gaia/research/sessions/**` namespace is reserved for #767. Goal A should
not introduce any canonical `.gaia/research_loop/**` state or any graph-session
state shape that conflicts with the #767 follow-up issue.

### 2.3 Future Agent Task Contract

PR #726's strongest idea is a self-contained task envelope:

```text
task envelope -> agent candidate -> validation -> artifact/delta -> next task
```

In the future graph-session work this should become an SDK contract, not a
second CLI product:

- task envelopes are versioned records under `.gaia/research/**`;
- candidates are validated against allowed refs and task kind;
- validation failures produce repair context for the same task;
- accepted candidates write graph/session deltas or review-run artifacts;
- gates decide whether to continue, pause, ask for human input, assess, report,
  or promote.

This lets an external agent framework use Gaia Research as a deterministic
protocol kernel while keeping semantic judgment in the agent. This section is a
handoff to #767, not a Goal A implementation requirement.

## 3. Refactors in the Gaia Core Repo (R1–R6, in order)

**R1. Extract a stable core SDK surface** (a prerequisite for the split that is
itself a behavior-preserving refactor):

- LKM client: `gaia/cli/commands/search/lkm/_client.py` → `gaia/lkm/client.py`
  (public module). Error model becomes typed exceptions (`LKMTransportError` /
  `LKMPermissionError` / `LKMNotFoundError`); the CLI layer translates to exit
  codes. Fixes review finding 11 (retry only on transport errors) in passing.
  `read_lkm_key()` moves with it.
- Authoring write API: `author/_authored.py`, `_writer.py`, `_common.py` →
  `gaia/engine/authoring/` (public); CLI author commands become thin shells.
  This also removes the `sync.py` purity violation. The public API design must
  fold in the fast/batch author mode requested by
  [#745](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/745) (batch statement
  writes with one explicit validation pass at the end) and add the post-write
  compile gate from [#764](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/764)
  — `append_statement` must stop swallowing `SyntaxError`, so a research-repo
  caller can never leave `authored/__init__.py` unparseable.
- Package dependency installer: the four `add_*_dependency` functions from
  `add.py` → `gaia/engine/packaging.py` or an equivalent public module.
- `gaia.engine.inquiry.state`: declare public in place (docs + semver
  commitment) for the six symbols research uses.
- Old import paths keep deprecation shims for one minor release.

**R2. CLI plugin mechanism**: define the entry-point group `gaia.cli_plugins`;
`main.py` discovers registered apps via `importlib.metadata.entry_points()` and
`add_typer`s them. Without gaia-research installed, `gaia research` prints an
install hint. Core has no such mechanism today (`main.py` is a static, flat
registry), but the implementation is small and reusable for future splits.

**R3. `lkm_materialize.py` stays in core** (shared with `gaia pkg add`) but
gains a public import path (e.g. `gaia/engine/materialize.py`); the research
repo imports it instead of vendoring. **Fix review finding 4 before the split
freeze** (content hash of the full claim id in the dist name) — both repos
depend on this naming convention, and changing it after the split requires a
two-repo lockstep.

**R4. Document the `.gaia/` namespace allocation**: core declares
`.gaia/research/**` owned by gaia-research and never writes under that prefix.

**R5. Remove research from core**: delete `gaia/engine/research/`,
`gaia/cli/commands/research*.py`, the 12 test files, the `gaia-research-loop`
skill, and research docs; the `llm` extra moves out with litellm; update help
snapshots; release note (including the LKM read-timeout 60s→120s default
change). Core bumps to 0.7.0 (R1+R2 ship earlier as 0.6.0).

**R6. Contract CI**: core adds a downstream-compat job that installs
gaia-research (main branch) and runs its smoke tests, so core changes cannot
silently break the five surfaces in section 1. Research tests leave the
`pr_gate` slice together with the code.

## 4. Refactors on the Research Side (S1–S9)

**S1. Pre-split fixes (while still in the monorepo; PR #755 follow-up)**:

- Close out [#764](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/764): surface
  silently skipped candidate relations as user-visible diagnostics, validate
  `claim_refs` against the evidence packet (reject unknown refs instead of
  passing them), and gate sync writes behind a compile check.
- Work through the [#761](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/761)
  scope list — it overlaps S1 almost item-for-item: moving run orchestration
  out of CLI support modules into engine APIs, hardening multi-focus
  checkpoint/resume, `None`-sentinel CLI override flags, sectioned-report
  failure/concurrency behavior, citation-fallback dedup, and typed
  retry/error contracts.
- `sync.py` switches to the R1 `gaia.engine.authoring` API.
- Remove typer from the engine entirely: `typer.Exit(2)` in
  `research_providers.py` becomes a typed provider exception; the pause stops
  masquerading as `ResearchOrchestratorError(exit_code=0)` and becomes an
  explicit `CheckpointPause` signal/return; `orchestrator_ports.py` Protocols
  document the error contract (finding 14).
- The report pipeline (`research_report_writing.py`, 908 LOC) currently lives
  in the CLI layer but is engine logic (concurrent section writing, citation
  merging); push it down to the engine, leaving only argument parsing in the
  CLI.

**S2. New SDK facade layer** (the only official entry point for downstream
apps):

```python
from gaia_research import ResearchClient

client = ResearchClient(package_dir)
run = client.run_review(topic=..., profile="review")
state = client.read_state(run.run_id)            # typed RunState (pydantic)
for ev in client.iter_events(run.run_id):        # typed event stream
    ...
```

- Freeze the dict contracts of `state.json` / `events.ndjson` / artifacts into
  pydantic models (today `contracts.py` holds prompt/schema dicts, not typed
  models).
- The ports in `orchestrator_ports.py` become the documented extension point
  (custom analysis/search providers).
- Expose high-level review-run methods (`run_review`, state/event readers) and
  review primitives (`build_landscape`, `assess_focus`, `write_report`) so
  product backends do not shell out to the CLI. Graph-session SDK methods
  (`open_session`, `next_task`, `submit_candidate`, `resume_session`) belong to
  #767.

**S3. Provider layering**: litellm goes behind the `gaia-research[llm]` extra;
the command/checkpoint providers are built-in and dependency-free. Fix the
rate-limit retry per review finding 18 (typed `RateLimitError` + exponential
backoff with jitter) in the same pass.

**S4. Versioned disk contract**: every file under `.gaia/research/**` carries an
explicit `schema_version` and a published contract document; downstream UIs key
compatibility off the schema version. Fixing finding 3 (all failure paths write
`status: failed` plus a `run.failed` event) is a precondition for this contract
being trustworthy.

The Goal A contract document must cover:

- review-run state/events/checkpoints/report artifacts;
- rebuild semantics for review-run state summaries;
- explicit ownership of `.gaia/research/**`, including a reservation that
  `.gaia/research/sessions/**` is deferred to #767.

**S5. Dual CLI entry**: console script `gaia-research` (standalone) plus the
`gaia.cli_plugins` entry point (preserving the `gaia research ...` muscle
memory).

**S6. Tests and CI**: the 12 unit files and the 4,378-line CLI E2E move over;
establish its own `pr_gate`; contract tests run against a pinned
`gaia-lang==<floor>`, with a nightly matrix row against gaia-lang main. Close
the coverage gaps the review identified (live-search failure path,
command-provider failure branches, stop tests consuming a real landscape
artifact).

**S7. Skill moves over**: the `gaia-research-loop` skill ships as gaia-research
package data. Core's `gaia skill register` currently only copies the bundled
`gaia/_skills/` tree — it needs a small change to scan skills exposed by
installed distributions (reusable entry-point group, e.g. `gaia.skills`).

**S8. Product readiness and doctor command**: absorb
[#762](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/762) into the
`gaia-research 0.1.0` release gate:

- `gaia research doctor` / `gaia-research doctor` checks package shape,
  `.gaia/research` writability, LKM credentials, provider/model config,
  profiles, run/session paths, and schema compatibility.
- Built-in profiles cover `quick`, `review`, and `deep` for review-run mode.
  Graph-session profiles belong to #767.
- Docs show short commands and SDK calls, not long flag recipes.
- CLI output and SDK return values make state, events, checkpoints,
  intermediate artifacts, and final report paths obvious.

PR #757's LKM onboarding belongs in the Gaia core LKM client/readiness surface;
`gaia-research doctor` consumes that public surface rather than duplicating
credential storage.

**S9. Independent versioning and releases**: own commitizen config, semver, and
changelog. The first `gaia-research 0.1.0` line should depend on
`gaia-lang>=0.6,<0.8` so it can run against both the 0.6 transition line
where Gaia core may still bundle research and the 0.7 removal line where
research is no longer in core. Its release gate must run contract CI against
the latest compatible 0.6 release and the 0.7.0 removal candidate before Gaia
core removes bundled research. Replicate core's alpha/beta/rc/stable
four-channel `workflow_dispatch` release process.

## 5. Migration Order (canonical Goal A phases 0-6)

The phase numbers below are canonical across this plan, the acceptance
checklist, and the implementation plan. Earlier maps that included
graph-session implementation as a split-completion phase are superseded by this
Goal A map.

| Phase | Content | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Make monorepo research movable by landing PR #755 and closing or owning high-risk #761/#764 blockers. | Research still lives in the monorepo, but the implementation is extraction-ready. |
| 1 | Extract Gaia core public APIs used by research: LKM client/readiness, authoring batch mode, materialization, packaging, inquiry-state contract, CLI plugin hook. | Gaia core exposes stable downstream surfaces without requiring research to import CLI-private modules. |
| 2 | Bootstrap the `gaia-research` repository and preserve/import history, including PR #726 as historical/spec input only. | New repo exists with package metadata, migrated code/tests/docs/skills, and no canonical `.gaia/research_loop/**` writes. |
| 3 | Build Goal A `gaia-research` review-run contracts and SDK. | Review-run contracts are typed, versioned, and SDK-accessible; graph-session contract work is linked to #767. |
| 4 | Re-enable review-run mode in the new repo. | Product/skill smoke tests produce observable state/events/report paths. |
| 5 | Product readiness, packaged skills, profiles, and doctor. | #762 acceptance checks pass and short happy paths are documented. |
| 6 | Contract CI, release, and Gaia core removal. | `gaia-research` passes downstream contract CI against the 0.7.0 removal candidate; Gaia core no longer owns research implementation. |

## 6. Risks and Decision Points

1. **Shared ownership of `lkm_materialize.py`** is the largest long-term
   friction point: both sides depend on the chain/paper package naming
   convention. Mitigation: the finding-4 content-hash fix, the naming
   convention written into the contract doc, and R6 contract-test coverage.
2. **`inquiry.state` API drift**: research sync reads and writes inquiry state
   deeply; a core schema change breaks research. Mitigation: R6 contract tests
   plus a state schema version.
3. **History preservation vs. clean start**: recommend `git filter-repo` to
   keep history (high forensic value for review/debugging) at the cost of a
   one-time tooling step.
4. **Downstream UIs**: every UI reading paths like
   `.gaia/research/runs/<id>/state.json` sees stable paths through the
   transition and after extraction; only the `schema_version` field is added —
   backward compatible.
5. **Graph-session scalability is a separate capability risk**: #767 must later
   prove append-only records, frontier cursors, delta indexes, and explicit
   full-rebuild operations. Goal A mitigates only by preserving extension points
   and not creating a conflicting protocol.
6. **When the split is not worth it**: if research iteration stays tightly
   synchronized with core (every core change drags a research change), two
   repos turn one PR into two. Current evidence (PR #755 is almost purely
   additive; the reverse dependency is one line) supports the split; if the
   `sync.py` ↔ authoring coupling deepens, re-evaluate.

## 7. Tracked Issues and Coverage

Open issues that the split plan must absorb, mapped to the work items that
cover them:

| Issue | What it tracks | Covered by | Phase | Exit criterion |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| [#764](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/764) | Candidate relations silently skipped during research sync; `claim_refs` validation holes; missing compile gate after authored writes | S1 (skip diagnostics, packet validation) + R1 (compile gate in the public authoring API) | 0–1 | Closed before the phase-2 repo bootstrap |
| [#761](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/761) | PR #755 review follow-ups: engine/CLI orchestration extraction, multi-focus checkpoint semantics, CLI override sentinels, report failure/concurrency, citation dedup, typed retry contracts | S1 (engine extraction, checkpoints, overrides) + S2 (report rendering consolidation) + S3 (retry contracts) | 0–4 | Core-owned blockers closed before phase 2; research-side remainder re-homed before phase 7 removal |
| [#745](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/745) | Fast/batch author mode for agent research workflows | R1 (the public `gaia.engine.authoring` API ships batch writes + single validation pass as a first-class mode, not a research-side workaround) | 1 | Closed by the R1 extraction PR |
| [#762](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/762) | New-user readiness for package-native research workflows: doctor, profiles, short commands, observable outputs | S8 (doctor/readiness, profile docs/tests) | 5 | Closed before publishing gaia-research 0.1.0 |
| [#767](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/issues/767) | Future large-scale graph-session design and linear-continuation contract | Follow-up issue outside Goal A | Post-Goal A | Must not block Goal A; must be referenced when implementing `.gaia/research/sessions/**` |

Related but closed/experimental:
PR #726 contributes task-envelope, candidate-validation, repair-context, and
gate lessons. It does not become a separate canonical `gaia-research-loop`
surface, and it must not reintroduce `.gaia/research_loop/**` as durable target
state.

**Coverage mechanism** — three enforcement points so these do not silently
fall through the split:

1. **PR linkage**: every implementing PR for S1/R1 work references its issue
   with `Closes #N` (or checks off the matching #761 checkbox), so issue state
   is the single source of progress truth — not this spec.
2. **Phase gates**: the phase table in section 5 is only advanceable when the
   issues listed for that phase in the table above are closed or explicitly
   re-homed. Phase 2 (repo bootstrap) is the hard cutoff for #764 and other
   core-side correctness blockers; phase 7 (core removal) is the hard cutoff
   for transferring or closing research-side follow-ups.
3. **Issue re-homing at bootstrap**: when the gaia-research repo is created in
   phase 2, any still-open research-side issue (or unchecked #761 item whose
   code moved) is transferred to the new repo's tracker (GitHub issue
   transfer), and the old issue is closed with a forwarding link. Core keeps
   only issues whose fix lands in core code (R1–R6 surfaces). The R6
   downstream-compat CI job is the backstop that re-detects anything both
   trackers lose.

## Appendix: Stay / Move Boundary at a Glance

| Stays in gaia-lang | Moves to gaia-research |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| LKM client (made public), `lkm_materialize.py`, authoring write API (made public), package installer, `inquiry.state`, credentials, `DEFAULT_LKM_INDEX_ID` | all 18 modules of `gaia/engine/research/**` (including `source_packages.py` and the atomic-write helpers in `artifacts.py`), the 5 `research*.py` CLI files, the report-writing pipeline, providers, the `gaia-research-loop` skill, research docs, the 12+1 test files, the `llm` extra |
