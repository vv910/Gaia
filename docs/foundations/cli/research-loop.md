# Research Loop Handoff

`gaia research` is no longer implemented by Gaia core. The upper workflow for
broad exploration, review-field mapping, focus synthesis, targeted expansion,
assessment, and report writing is owned by the external `gaia-research`
package, which may register the `gaia research` command through the
`gaia.cli_plugins` entry point group.

Gaia core keeps the primitives that `gaia-research` composes: package
scaffolding and dependency management, `gaia search lkm`, inquiry state,
authoring/materialization APIs, trace/review utilities, and compilation /
inference / rendering. If `gaia-research` is not installed, `gaia research`
prints a hidden install hint instead of falling back to the old core workflow.

This file is a migration reference for the old package-native loop. The
canonical workflow docs should live in `gaia-research/docs/foundations/` after
the split. The old Gaia repo research implementation and its migrated tests can
be deleted in a dedicated cleanup PR; the handoff PR only removes the public
root CLI ownership.

## Historical Loop

The former `gaia research` workflow covered broad exploration, review-field
mapping, focus synthesis, targeted expansion, and evidence assessment. Its
canonical state lived in Gaia package source and Gaia inquiry state; research
JSON existed only as trace, cache, or audit output.

The guiding rule is:

> Do not create a second research data model when Gaia package primitives or
> `gaia inquiry` can express the same state.

## State Model

Research state has three layers.

| Layer | Canonical? | Examples | Purpose |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| Package source | yes | `question(...)`, `note(...)`, `candidate_relation(...)`, `claim(...)`, `derive(...)`, `materialize(...)`, package dependencies | Durable knowledge and scaffolded knowledge |
| Inquiry state | yes | current focus, open obligations, hypotheses, rejections, tactic log | Mutable research process state |
| Research trace | no | raw search JSON, LLM analysis JSON, command events, final report, timing, stop metrics | Reproducibility, debugging, meeting review |

The package and inquiry state are what later compilation, review, inference,
publication, and LKM ingestion should consume. Trace files should be readable and
auditable, but they are not the source of truth for scientific knowledge.

## Loop Shape

The loop remains breadth-first at the start and narrows only after the field
landscape is visible:

```text
broad explore
  -> review field-map induction
  -> coverage expansion for thin review buckets
  -> focus synthesis
  -> targeted expand
  -> selected evidence + deep materialization
  -> assess one focus
  -> plan / write / stitch final report sections
  -> propose next open-ended research questions
  -> promote mature scaffold
  -> continue expand / assess / publish
```

Early exploration should map model families, probe families, methods,
systematics, and missing coverage. The field map turns that breadth into a
review taxonomy before the loop chooses assessable focuses. After targeted
expansion, the runner selects a compact evidence packet and deep-materializes
only the paper graphs or reasoning chains needed for the selected focus.
Assessment then reads that high-density packet instead of the full broad
landscape. Final prose is written after assessment from a report plan and
section drafts, so the assessment LLM can stay judgment-focused.

## Command Semantics

### `gaia research explore`

Broadly scan LKM results and update the package-local research process.

Canonical writes:

- materialize this scan's search items as a shallow local Gaia source package
  and attach it with the same local dependency contract as `gaia pkg add
  --local`;
- create or refresh inquiry hypotheses for promising directions;
- create inquiry obligations for obvious coverage gaps;
- keep selected paper leads as candidates for later expansion.

Trace writes:

- raw search result cache;
- landscape summary;
- command/event log.

Default guardrail: write only shallow source claims/notes from the already
available search output. Do not deep-pull paper graphs during the first broad
scan.

The landscape keeps artifact-local `items` for trace readability. When source
materialization succeeds, each item also gets `source_package_ref.ref`, a Gaia
package QID that assessment analysis can use in `claim_refs` for scaffolded
`candidate_relation(...)` writes.

### `gaia research focus`

Turn a landscape into a small set of assessable research questions.

Canonical writes:

- up to 3 accepted focuses become `question(...)` declarations in package source;
- the active focus is recorded with `gaia inquiry focus`;
- coverage gaps become `gaia inquiry obligation` records;
- tentative interpretations may become `gaia inquiry hypothesis` records.

Trace writes:

- LLM focus-analysis input/output;
- focus-selection rationale;
- human-readable focus report.

`focuses.json` is not a canonical focus registry. It is only an audit record of
one synthesis step.

### `gaia research expand`

Expand around a focus or obligation.

Canonical writes:

- selected paper leads stay as candidates for assessment;
- new gaps update inquiry obligations;
- new working interpretations update inquiry hypotheses.

Trace writes:

- targeted search cache;
- expansion summary;
- paper-candidate rationale.

Expansion does not materialize paper graphs. It fills coverage around a focus or
obligation without letting a few early papers dominate the map.

### `gaia research assess`

Assess one focus against selected evidence.

Canonical writes:

- optional `--materialize-paper <paper_id>` materializes a selected full LKM
  paper graph as a deep local evidence package;
- optional `--materialize-paper-from-claim <claim_id>` resolves a selected LKM
  claim to its backing paper graph, then materializes that full paper package;
- optional `--materialize-chain <claim_id>` materializes selected LKM claim
  reasoning chains as a focused local evidence package without pulling the
  whole paper graph;
- unresolved issues become inquiry obligations;
- tentative interpretations become inquiry hypotheses or `note(...)`;
- weak relations become `candidate_relation(...)` scaffolds;

Trace writes:

- assessment LLM input/output;
- evidence table or citation cache;
- structured evidence relations, limitations, and next-query directions;
- stop/review metrics.

Assessment should not normally write formal `claim(...)`, `contradict(...)`,
`equal(...)`, or `derive(...)` records. Those require a later scaffold-promotion
gate.

### `gaia research propose`

Turn an assessment into open-ended next research directions.

Canonical writes:

- by default, none; proposals are written as a reviewable trace artifact;
- with `--accept`, up to 3 accepted `research_question` proposals become package
  `question(...)` declarations;
- accepted proposal questions can become the active inquiry focus;
- tentative hypotheses become inquiry hypotheses;
- unresolved requirements become inquiry obligations.

Trace writes:

- proposal artifact with research questions, tentative hypotheses, candidate
  obligations, source refs, and notes;
- command/event log recording whether proposals were accepted.

Proposal is not a claim-writing step. It must not emit stable truth claims. It
is the handoff from evidence assessment to the next cycle of research,
simulation, experiment, proof, benchmark, or targeted evidence gathering.

### `gaia research promote`

Promote mature scaffolded package state into formal knowledge.

Canonical writes:

- `candidate_relation(...)` -> formal relation when evidence and obligations
  support the stronger commitment;
- tentative finding -> `claim(...)` when it is well scoped and grounded;
- reasoning chain -> `derive(...)` when premises and conclusion are explicit;
- scaffold link -> `materialize(...)` to record what formal record supersedes
  the scaffold.

Trace writes:

- promotion rationale;
- rejected or deferred candidates;
- review/check output.

Promotion is narrow. It is not the orchestrator for the whole research loop.
Formal source synthesis from assessment scaffolds remains deferred until a
separate promotion contract and review gate are designed.

## Minimal CLI Story

The user-facing commands should stay short because inquiry writes are the
default behavior:

```bash
gaia research explore "$PKG" --mode scan --search-json "$RUN/searches/01.json"

gaia research focus "$PKG" --analysis-json "$RUN/analysis/focus-analysis.json"

gaia research expand "$PKG" \
  --focus rq_h0_systematics_vs_new_physics \
  --search-json "$RUN/searches/targeted-01.json"

gaia research assess "$PKG" \
  --focus rq_h0_systematics_vs_new_physics \
  --materialize-paper 811827932371615744 \
  --materialize-chain gcn_selected_reasoning_claim \
  --analysis-json "$RUN/analysis/assess-analysis.json"

gaia research propose "$PKG" \
  --from-assessment "$RUN/artifacts/assessment.json" \
  --analysis-json "$RUN/analysis/proposal-analysis.json" \
  --accept

gaia research promote "$PKG" \
  --scaffold cand_h0_distance_ladder_vs_sound_horizon \
  --by formal_h0_tension_relation
```

Opt-out flags are for evaluation and debugging:

- `--dry-run`: show planned writes without applying them;

`--materialize-paper`, `--materialize-paper-from-claim`, and
`--materialize-chain` are the explicit deep paths. Use them after a focus,
paper lead, or claim lead is selected, not during the initial broad landscape
scan. Prefer `--materialize-chain` when the assessment needs the local
premise-conclusion chain for one claim but does not need the whole paper graph.

## Mapping From Old Artifacts

| Old artifact concept | Canonical home | Trace role |
|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| review field map | non-canonical review scaffold | record induced taxonomy, controversy axes, and coverage-expansion rationale |
| focus artifact | `question(...)`, inquiry focus, inquiry obligations | record LLM synthesis and ranking |
| review coverage gap | field-map/focus/assessment artifact unless it blocks the current focus | keep original explanation and suggested queries |
| blocking focus gap | inquiry obligation | preserve actionability rationale |
| assessment relation | `candidate_relation(...)` until promoted | preserve evidence snippets and citation anchors |
| candidate obligation | inquiry obligation | preserve assessment rationale |
| search item | shallow local source package added through `gaia pkg add --local` semantics | keep raw row for trace and LLM contract |
| paper lead | deep `gaia pkg add --lkm-paper` only when selected | keep raw search/cache row and pull candidate command |
| proposal | package `question(...)` only when accepted; otherwise inquiry hypothesis / obligation | keep proposal rationale and source refs |
| stable conclusion | `claim(...)` / `derive(...)` / formal relation | preserve review history |
| stop criteria | inquiry/review decision input | record metrics and timing |

Raw search results, command traces, timing, and LLM analysis JSON remain useful,
but they are non-canonical.

## Relationship To `gaia-lkm-explore`

The older `gaia-lkm-explore` workflow is a useful reference for three ideas:

- package-local state should steer the next round;
- open inquiry obligations should influence frontier selection;
- compile/review/infer checkpoints should happen between rounds.

The new research loop differs in one important way: broad landscape, focus
synthesis, targeted expansion, assessment, and scaffold promotion are separate
steps. This prevents the loop from narrowing too early around one frontier or
one paper cluster.

## Current Ownership Status

Gaia core no longer ships the implementation described above. The active owner
for topic-to-report research workflow code, docs, and future graph-session work
is the external `gaia-research` repository.

The old `gaia-lkm-explore` code and tests are archived as reference-only prior
art in `gaia-research/docs/prior-art/lkm-explorer/`. The archive is not a Gaia
core package, not a console script, not tested as production code, and not a
compatibility contract.

Gaia core keeps only the primitives that research workflows compose:

- package scaffolding and dependency management;
- `gaia search lkm`;
- inquiry state;
- authoring and materialization APIs;
- trace/review utilities;
- compile, infer, render, and package-graph visualization.
