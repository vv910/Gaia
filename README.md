Gaia is a Python DSL and CLI for plausible reasoning. It helps you, or your
agent, turn scientific arguments into explicit claims, reviewable reasoning
steps, and probabilistic belief updates.

The goal is practical: constrain an LLM agent with scientific logic until it can
act more like **Jaynes' Robot**. The agent must say what it assumes, expose how
claims depend on each other, and let probability theory compute what follows
from the declared information set.

## Version Status

`main` is the active v0.5 development trunk. The published v0.5 artifact is
currently the alpha preview `gaia-lang==0.5.0a1`; the source tree is tracking
the upcoming `0.5.0` line until the stable v0.5 release is cut.

- Use `gaia-lang==0.5.0a1` or `pip install --pre gaia-lang` if you want the
  current v0.5 alpha CLI, DSL, Bayes, and package workflow.
- The exact alpha source is the
  [`v0.5.0a1`](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/releases/tag/v0.5.0a1)
  tag at `803c0918`.
- Use `gaia-lang==0.4.4` and the [`release/0.4`](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia/tree/release/0.4)
  branch if you need the stable v0.4.x line.
- v0.5 is breaking relative to v0.4; see the
  [v0.5.0a1 release notes](docs/releases/0.5.0a1.md) and
  [migration guide](docs/migration.md).
- New PRs should target `main`; exact prerelease sources are immutable tags
  such as `v0.5.0a1`.

## What Gaia Does

```text
Author the Python DSL directly (primary)   [optional: gaia author CLI]
  -> gaia build compile
  -> Gaia IR + factor graph
  -> gaia run infer
  -> posterior beliefs and review artifacts
```

**Start here:** run `gaia sdk` to generate the SDK reference plus a one-page
`CHEATSHEET.md`, then write the DSL directly. Direct SDK authoring is the
primary path; the `gaia author` CLI is an optional convenience (see the
[authoring workflow](docs/for-users/authoring-workflow.md)).

In v0.5, the recommended authoring style is deliberately small — write these
statements directly in Python:

- write uncertain scientific statements as `claim(...)`;
- keep definitions, setups, and context as non-probabilistic `note(...)`;
- connect claims with `derive(...)`, `observe(...)`, `compute(...)`, and
  `infer(...)`;
- declare reviewable relations with `equal(...)`, `contradict(...)`,
  `exclusive(...)`, and `associate(...)`;
- assign external probabilities with `register_prior(...)` only when there is a
  real independent probabilistic input;
- leave unsupported independent inputs unset, so Gaia applies MaxEnt instead of
  pretending that a neutral `0.5` was a sourced prior.

Review status and probability are separate. Local inference shows what the
compiled graph currently implies numerically. Review and gate commands decide
whether the reasoning is publishable, auditable, or ready to register.

## Install

For the current v0.5 alpha:

```bash
pip install gaia-lang==0.5.0a1
```

Or, if you intentionally allow prereleases:

```bash
pip install --pre gaia-lang
```

For the stable v0.4.x line:

```bash
pip install gaia-lang==0.4.4
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/Gaia.git
cd Gaia
uv sync --extra dev
```

## Quick Start

```bash
gaia build init my-paper-gaia

# Generate the SDK reference + one-page cheat sheet, then author directly.
gaia sdk                       # writes ./gaia-sdk/CHEATSHEET.md + full reference

# Primary path: edit src/my_paper/__init__.py and write the DSL directly, e.g.
#   intervention_changes_observable = claim("The intervention changes the observable.")

# Optional convenience: the same statement via the CLI (writes into authored/).
gaia author claim "The intervention changes the observable." \
  --dsl-binding-name intervention_changes_observable --target ./my-paper-gaia

cd my-paper-gaia

gaia build compile .
gaia build check --hole .
gaia run infer .
```

For a full walkthrough, see [`docs/for-users/quick-start.md`](docs/for-users/quick-start.md).

## Minimal DSL Example

```python
from gaia.engine.lang import claim, contradict, derive, equal, note, register_prior

setup = note("A heavy body and a light body are tied together.")

daily_observation = claim("In air, heavy bodies often fall faster than light bodies.")
aristotle_model = claim("Weight itself causes greater natural falling speed.")
medium_model = claim("In-air speed differences are caused by medium resistance.")

register_prior(
    daily_observation,
    0.9,
    justification="Everyday in-air observations make this background likely.",
)

aristotle_daily = derive(
    "Under the weight-speed model, heavy bodies should fall faster in air.",
    given=[aristotle_model],
)
equal(aristotle_daily, daily_observation)

medium_daily = derive(
    "Under the medium-resistance model, heavy bodies can fall faster in air.",
    given=[medium_model],
)
equal(medium_daily, daily_observation)

composite_faster = derive(
    "The tied composite should fall faster than the heavy body alone.",
    given=[aristotle_model],
    background=[setup],
)
composite_slower = derive(
    "The tied composite should fall slower than the heavy body alone.",
    given=[aristotle_model],
    background=[setup],
)
contradict(composite_faster, composite_slower)

vacuum_equal_fall_prediction = derive(
    "In vacuum, bodies of different weights fall at the same rate.",
    given=[medium_model],
)
```

The runnable package lives in
[`examples/galileo-v0-5-gaia`](examples/galileo-v0-5-gaia).

## Where the Probabilities Come From

Run the Galileo example:

```bash
gaia build compile examples/galileo-v0-5-gaia
gaia run infer examples/galileo-v0-5-gaia
```

The compiled reasoning graph has three paths: both candidate models can explain
the daily in-air observation, but only the Aristotelian weight-speed model also
creates the tied-body contradiction.

Current local inference on `main` / the v0.5 line gives:

| Claim | Starting information | Local posterior belief |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------------:|
| `daily_observation` | `register_prior(..., 0.9)` from `priors.py` | 0.964 |
| `aristotle_model` | independent input with no external prior, so MaxEnt starts it at 0.5 | 0.010 |
| `medium_model` | independent input with no external prior, so MaxEnt starts it at 0.5 | 0.642 |
| `vacuum_equal_fall_prediction` | derived claim, no independent prior | 0.821 |

Those posteriors are not hand-written. Gaia lowers the compiled package into a
factor graph:

- `register_prior(...)` writes auditable prior records. The resolver chooses the
  winning record and stores it in claim metadata before inference.
- An independent claim with no prior record gets the MaxEnt neutral baseline
  rather than a fake author prior.
- `derive(...)` lowers to a Jaynes-style conditional implication. If the premise
  is true, the conclusion is true up to the Cromwell bound; if the premise is
  false, the derivation contributes no information and falls back to the
  conclusion's base rate, usually MaxEnt.
- `equal(...)` and `contradict(...)` assert deterministic relation factors. In
  the Galileo graph, both models explain the daily observation, but the
  Aristotelian model also implies two tied-body predictions that cannot both be
  true. Inference therefore strongly suppresses that model.
- The final numbers are posterior marginals computed by `gaia run infer`; for
  this small graph Gaia uses exact Junction Tree inference.

## v0.5 Authoring Surface

Run `gaia sdk` for the full per-symbol reference + cheat sheet. The
**primary** column is what you write directly in Python; the **optional CLI
helper** column is the convenience equivalent (writes into `authored/`).

| Layer | Primary — write directly (Python DSL) | Optional CLI helper |
|-------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Knowledge | `claim`, `note`, `question` | `gaia author claim/note/question` |
| Reasoning actions | `derive`, `observe`, `compute`, `infer` | `gaia author derive/observe/compute/infer` |
| Relations | `equal`, `contradict`, `exclusive`, `associate`, `decompose` | `gaia author equal/contradict/exclusive/associate/decompose` |
| Scaffolds | `depends_on`, `candidate_relation`, `materialize` | `gaia author depends-on/candidate-relation/materialize` |
| Composition | `compose`, `composition` | `gaia author compose/composition` |
| Priors | `register_prior` | `gaia author register-prior` |
| Typed terms | `Variable`, `Nat`, `Real`, `Probability`, `Bool` | `gaia author variable` |
| Continuous quantities | `Normal`, `LogNormal`, `Beta`, `Gamma`, `StudentT`, `Cauchy`, `ChiSquared`, `Binomial`, `Poisson` | `gaia bayes <distribution>` for CLI-authored Bayes snippets |
| Bayesian model comparisons | `gaia.engine.bayes.model`, `data`, `compare` | `gaia bayes model/compare` |

Old v5 names remain available only through the compatibility layer. New packages
should use the v0.5 surface above.

## CLI Map

The CLI is self-documenting. Use `gaia --help`, `gaia <group> --help`, and
`gaia <group> <verb> --help` as the command-surface authority.

| Group | Verbs | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `gaia build` | `init`, `compile`, `check` | Create packages, compile Python DSL to Gaia IR, and validate structure/prior holes/gates. |
| `gaia sdk` | _(no subcommand)_ | **Start here.** Generate the SDK reference + one-page `CHEATSHEET.md`, then author the DSL directly. |
| `gaia author` | `claim`, `note`, `question`, `derive`, `observe`, `compute`, `infer`, `equal`, `contradict`, `exclusive`, `associate`, `decompose`, `parameter`, `register-prior`, `variable`, `depends-on`, `candidate-relation`, `materialize`, `compose`, `composition` | Optional convenience over direct authoring: append checked DSL statements into the package's `authored/` submodule. |
| `gaia bayes` | `model`, `compare`, `binomial`, `beta-binomial`, `poisson`, `normal`, `log-normal`, `beta`, `exponential`, `gamma`, `student-t`, `cauchy`, `chi-squared` | CLI helpers for Bayesian model comparison declarations and distribution literals. |
| `gaia pkg` | `add`, `add-import`, `add-module`, `register`, `scaffold` | Manage package dependencies, sibling modules, scaffolds, and registry publication. |
| `gaia run` | `infer`, `render` | Compute local posterior beliefs and render package outputs. |
| `gaia inspect` | `starmap` | Inspect compiled graph visualizations. |
| `gaia inquiry` | `focus`, `review`, `obligation`, `hypothesis`, `tactics`, `reject` | Run the semantic inquiry and review loop over a compiled package. |
| `gaia trace` | `verify`, `review`, `show` | Verify and review ARM execution traces. |
| `gaia review` | skeleton only | Reserved top-level home for future reviewer tooling; do not confuse it with `gaia inquiry review` or `gaia trace review`. |
| `gaia search` | `lkm auth`, `lkm knowledge`, `lkm reasoning`, `lkm nodes`, `lkm package` | Query an external retrieval backend; the `lkm` backend wraps the Bohrium LKM knowledge-graph search API. |

The Bohrium LKM knowledge-graph search backend is available under `gaia search lkm`; run `gaia search lkm auth login` to set up your access key (or set `GAIA_LKM_ACCESS_KEY` / `LKM_ACCESS_KEY`), then `gaia search lkm --help` for the full verb surface.

The authoring CLI is intentionally conservative: target files must already
exist, sibling files should be created with `gaia pkg add-module`, and literal
`__all__` blocks are updated only when the verb is meant to export the new
binding.
