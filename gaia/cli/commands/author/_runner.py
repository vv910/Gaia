"""Shared verb dispatch for ``gaia author <verb>``.

Each per-verb module (:mod:`.claim`, :mod:`.equal`, :mod:`.derive`, ...)
constructs a :class:`ProposedAuthorOp` from its parsed flags and calls
:func:`run_author_op` to execute the uniform pipeline:

    1. pre-write check    (always; fail-fast; no flag)
    2. snapshot           (capture target file contents)
    3. write              (only if pre-write OK)
    4. post-write check   (only if pre-write OK; gated by --check/--no-check)
    5. rollback on fail   (restore snapshot if postwrite fails)
    6. emit envelope      (JSON or human; exits with semantic code)

The runner owns the JSON envelope and exit-code semantics so individual
verbs only have to know their argument-to-snippet mapping.

The ``--interactive`` flag is wired uniformly: any pre-write warning
surfaces a numbered prompt, default-skip semantics. In JSON mode (the
default) the prompts are auto-suppressed and the run proceeds, since the
agent consumer does not have stdin to drive prompts. See the
``_maybe_consume_warnings`` helper for the activation logic.

Lightweight snapshot/rollback: before the write phase mutates
``write_target``, the runner captures the file's existing text (or
``None`` if absent). On postwrite failure the snapshot is restored and
a ``writer.rolled_back`` diagnostic appended to the envelope. This
handles the single-file case; the compose / pkg-scaffold /
pkg-add_module verbs have their own write surfaces and are documented
as residual ordering hazards in the PR body.
