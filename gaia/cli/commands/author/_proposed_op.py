"""Proposed-author-operation dataclass shared by every ``gaia author`` verb.

The :class:`ProposedAuthorOp` value is the bridge between the CLI flag
surface (verb-specific argparse-shaped inputs) and the verb-agnostic
pre-write check pipeline (:mod:`._prewrite`). Each verb constructs one of
these from its parsed arguments, hands it to ``prewrite_check``, and on
pass appends ``generated_code`` to ``target_path / source_root /
__init__.py``.

The dataclass intentionally mirrors the v0.5 runtime taxonomy from
``gaia.engine.lang.runtime.action`` — ``Reasoning`` vs ``GaiaGraph`` —
because the pre-write checks need to know, for example, whether
``self`` references in the produced statement are even allowed (warrant-
bearing reasoning) or always invalid (scaffold-only graphs).

class ProposedAuthorOp:
    """A pending author operation, ready to be validated and written.

    Attributes:
        verb: DSL verb name (``"claim"``, ``"equal"``, ``"derive"``, ...).
            Drives diagnostic ``verb`` field + human-readable rendering.
        kind: Runtime taxonomy slot — see :data:`OpKind`.
        label: Module-scope identifier the generated statement binds to.
            ``None`` is legal for some verbs (e.g. ``register_prior``,
            where the call returns ``None`` and the statement has no
            LHS); most verbs require it so the written statement is
            referenceable.
        references: Identifier names that must resolve in either the
            current package's module scope or a loaded dep. Empty list
            means "no references to check".
        generated_code: The Python snippet that will be appended to the
            target package's source file if pre-write passes. Must be a
            self-contained statement; the writer adds a trailing newline
            but does not otherwise rewrite the snippet.
        required_imports: Module-level imports the generated code depends
            on. ``("derive",)`` means ``from gaia.engine.lang import
            derive`` must exist (or be added) in the target module.
            Pre-write verifies they're present.
