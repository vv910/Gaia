"""Post-write integration with ``gaia build check``.

Pre-write and post-write are **separate gates**. Pre-write always runs
fail-fast (no flag); post-write ``gaia build check`` runs by default
after a successful write, gated by ``--check / --no-check`` (default
on). When pre-write fails, post-write is short-circuited — there's no
point running compile-grade validation against a write that did not
happen.

This module talks to the engine through its programmatic API
(``load_gaia_package`` + ``compile_loaded_package_artifact``) rather than
shelling out to ``gaia build check``: it's faster, lets us thread our
diagnostic ``where`` records, and avoids subprocess marshalling.

    tagged ``source="postwrite"`` so JSON consumers can distinguish them
