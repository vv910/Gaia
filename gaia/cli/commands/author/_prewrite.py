"""Pre-write defensive sanity check for ``gaia author <verb>``.

Pre-write covers exactly 4 invariants — anything beyond stays in
post-write ``gaia build check`` and its lowering pipeline:

(a) **Target package structural validity** — the cwd / ``--target`` path is
    a real Gaia knowledge package: ``pyproject.toml`` exists, parses as
    TOML, declares ``[tool.gaia].type = "knowledge-package"``, and a
    source root directory matching the import name exists.

(b) **Input syntax validity** — the proposed code snippet
    (:attr:`ProposedAuthorOp.generated_code`) ``ast.parse``-s without
    raising ``SyntaxError``.

(c) **Identifier collision + reference resolution** — the proposed
    ``label`` does not collide with an already-bound name in the package's
    module scope or ``__all__``; each name in
    :attr:`ProposedAuthorOp.references` resolves in the same scope.

(d) **Statement-order + structural sanity** — the proposed statement has
    no self-loops (``label`` not in ``references``) and the produced
    snippet does not redeclare ``__all__`` with a conflicting symbol.

Two checks are *deliberately out of scope* for pre-write:

* forward-ref-in-dep detection (would require partial-load of the
  dependency graph);
* module-level ``__all__`` export simulation (would require simulating
  the import-time evaluation of ``__init__.py``).

Both belong on post-write because they need state that pre-write would
have to half-build the package to obtain.

Pre-write surfaces two **warning** kinds:

* ``prewrite.label_shadow`` — the proposed label matches a local
  binding that is not in ``__all__`` (shadowing a private name). Hint:
  add to ``__all__`` or rename.
* ``prewrite.deprecated_ref`` — the proposed op references a DSL name
  that the engine flags as deprecated (``context`` / ``setting`` /
  ``noisy_and`` / ``not_`` / ``and_`` / ``or_`` / ``contradiction`` /
  ``equivalence`` / ``complement`` / ``disjunction`` / etc.). Hint:
  the replacement spelling per the engine's deprecation message.

Both warnings flow through the existing ``--interactive`` activation
in :func:`gaia.cli.commands.author._runner.run_author_op`.

Deprecated-name discovery happens via an AST scan of the engine DSL
source (see :mod:`gaia.cli.commands.author._deprecation_scan`). The
scan walks ``gaia.engine.lang.dsl.**.py`` at first use, recognising
both the direct ``warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning)`` shape and
the indirect ``_warn_deprecated_*(name, replacement)`` helper shape
used in the v0.5 engine source. A small fallback dict survives for any
deprecation expressed in a shape the scanner does not yet model.

    Detection logic:

    * Parse ``source_init_path`` for top-level bindings + ``__all__``
      entries. (We re-parse rather than reusing ``module_symbols``
      because ``module_symbols`` is the *union* across siblings and we
      need ``__all__`` membership.)
    * If ``label`` is bound locally but not in ``__all__``, emit
      ``prewrite.label_shadow``.

    The existing collision invariant (c) already fires when the label
    is already bound — so in practice this warning only fires when the
    user passes ``--no-check`` (skip collision masking) plus the label
    happens to match a private binding. The warning's main load is
    catching subtle ``__all__`` omissions during agent-driven
    authoring.

    Currently invariant (c) intercepts most shadow cases as a hard
    error, so the warning runs after (c) passes; it kicks in for the
    edge cases where the binding came from a sibling source file (not
    the entrypoint) — the symbol-collection loop pulls names from every
    ``.py``, but ``__all__`` only lives in ``__init__.py``.
